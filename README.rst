Silverpop Engage API client
===========================

Important
=========

This is a **very** early version of a Silverpop Engage API client which is by 
far not production ready. It should in no way be considered stable.

Only the basic functionality is implemented. You probably don't want this yet.

Tests
=====

To make the tests work you have to create a settings.py within the tests 
folder and to provide an ENGAGE_URL as well as your ENGAGE_USERNAME and 
ENGAGE_PASSWORD.
